# Image-Colorisation
This is a project to color in greyscale pictures based on very little color information.

This is just the first attempt. There is a file called main1.m, that basically does all it should, but without a GUI. 
An then, there is the colorisation_gui.m file that adds a GUI and makes things a bit more fun.

So far, the "load image" button does not have any functionality assigned to it. The other buttons work pretty well.
